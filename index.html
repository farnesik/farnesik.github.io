        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! My name is Kyle Farnesi. I am about to be a graduate from Northeastern University and I've been climbing for about as long as I have been here.
            It has become a large part of my life, meeting an amazing community of friends and keeping more physically fit than I ever was playing traditional sports.
            If you want to read more about climbing, check out my <a href="explain.html">Climbing</a> page!
            Some more about me: I've always been a big fan of videogames. I mostly play on my PC and my Switch, but I have a good collection of Xbox360 and old Nintendo games.
            My other big love in my life is music where I try to listen to as much new music as possible. I try to listen to a new album every day, and I'm constantly looking to see my listening statistics and what other people are listening to this week!
            Otherwise, I'm always trying to learn new skills like right now I'm working on 3D modeling in Blender (which has been a very slow process) and how to draw proficiently.
            I typically am a bit too perfectionist for art so I take way too much time, but I'm trying to get over that so I can truly enjoy the creation process and make more projects come true rather than just as ideas.
        </p>
